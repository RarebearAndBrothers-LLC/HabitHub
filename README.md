# PushUpPro

Studies show that behavior change is hard; most attempts at behavior change fail within the first two weeks. Experts suggest only start with one habit change at a time; this is an app to help people trying to catch traction in well-being, health, or fitness start with something you can anywhere you have a floor :). 

Push Up Pro is a full-stack app that enables users to record their Push-ups via text message to their accounts. 
The app receives and tracks user input and displays this infomration to the user. 
Upon receiving enough data the app can predict progress for users as they continue logging. 

Users can set goals and reminders and the app will message them to remind them of thier neccessary inputs in order to meet thier expected goals. 

As a User I can create an account, record via text-message or manual entry on the app how many push-ups done for that day. 

User can set goals and reminders so that the app can message them throughout the day to do their work. 

App is mobile-friendly.
